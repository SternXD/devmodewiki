## Prerequisites

Before compiling emulators, ensure you have:

- **Visual Studio 2022** installed with proper components
- **Git** for cloning repositories
- **Python** (for some build scripts)
- **Sufficient disk space** (builds can be large)

## Troubleshooting

Compilation can be complex and may fail due to:
- Missing dependencies
- Version conflicts
- Platform-specific issues

Each guide includes troubleshooting sections for common issues.
