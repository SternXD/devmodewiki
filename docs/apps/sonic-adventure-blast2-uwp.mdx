## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following conditions are met:

1.  **Xbox Developer Mode Activated:** Your Xbox Series S/X must be successfully set up and running in Developer Mode.
2.  **Remote Access Enabled:** Remote Access must be enabled and configured within the Xbox Dev Home application.
3.  **External USB Drive:** A USB drive formatted as NTFS with full read/write permissions set for UWP applications.
4.  **PC:** A Windows PC for downloading files and accessing the Xbox Device Portal.

> **Need help with prerequisites?** See the [_Xbox Developer Mode Setup_](/docs/xbox-setup/xbox-developer-mode-setup) guide for detailed instructions on activating Dev Mode, setting up Remote Access, and preparing a USB drive.

## Step 1: Downloading Files

The necessary files are obtained from the official GitHub repository releases page.

1.  **Go to Xbox Dev Store:** See the [Installation Process](#installation-process) section below for download instructions.
2.  **Find SAB2:** Go to the "Games" tab and scroll down to find "Sonic Adventure Blast 2 (SAB2)".
3.  **Go to Official Page:** *Instead of clicking "Download"*, click the **"Official Page"** button. This will take you to the GitHub repository (`worleydl/SAB2-uwp`).
4.  **Navigate to Releases:** On the GitHub page, find the "Releases" section (usually on the right side) and click on the latest release (e.g., "SAB2-UWP v1.0.0").
5.  **Download Required Files:** Under the "Assets" section of the release, download the following three files:
    *   `SAB2_1.0.0_x64.msixbundle` (The main application package)
    *   `Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.appx` (The necessary dependency)
    *   `SonicAdventureBlast2_1.1.zip` (The game content files - *Note: The version number might differ from the main package*)
6.  **Save Files:** Save these three files to a known location on your PC.

## Step 2: Prepare External USB Drive

The game's core content (`Settings` and `res` folders) needs to be placed on your external USB drive.

1.  **Extract Game Content:** On your PC, locate the `SonicAdventureBlast2_1.1.zip` file you downloaded and extract its contents using a tool like 7-Zip or Windows Explorer's built-in extractor. This will create a folder (e.g., `SonicAdventureBlast2_1.1`) containing `Settings` and `res` subfolders.
2.  **Create `sab2` Folder:** Connect your prepared external USB drive to your PC. Create a new folder directly in the *root directory* of the USB drive and name it exactly `sab2`.
3.  **Copy Game Folders:**
    *   Open the extracted `SonicAdventureBlast2_1.1` folder.
    *   Select *both* the `Settings` folder and the `res` folder.
    *   Copy these two folders.
    *   Navigate into the `sab2` folder you created on your USB drive.
    *   Paste the `Settings` and `res` folders directly inside the `sab2` folder. Your structure should look like `E:\sab2\Settings` and `E:\sab2\res` (assuming `E:\` is your USB drive).
4. **Keep Files:** Keep the downloaded `.msixbundle` and `.appx` files on your PC for the next step. You can optionally delete the downloaded `.zip` and the extracted game content folder *from your PC* after copying them to the USB drive.

## Step 3: Install via Device Portal

Use the Xbox Device Portal to install the application package and its dependency.

1.  **Access Dev Portal:** On your PC, open a web browser and navigate to the Remote Access URL displayed in Dev Home on your Xbox.
2.  **Bypass Security Warning:** If necessary, bypass the browser's security warning.
3.  **Navigate to "Add":** Under "My games & apps", click "Add".
4.  **Upload MSIXBUNDLE:** Click "Choose File" (or drag and drop) and select the `SAB2_1.0.0_x64.msixbundle` file from your PC.
5.  **Upload Dependency:** Click "Next". On the dependency page:
    *   Click "Choose File" (or drag and drop).
    *   Select the `Microsoft.VCLibs.x64.14.00.appx` file.
6.  **Start Installation:** Click "Start" and wait for the installation to complete ("Package successfully registered"). Click "Done".

## Step 4: Configure on Xbox

Set the application type to "Game" for optimal performance.

1.  **Locate SAB2 in Dev Home:** On your Xbox, go back to Dev Home. Find `sab2-uwp` (or similar name) in the list.
2.  **Change Type to "Game":**
    *   Highlight the app and press the "View" button (two overlapping squares).
    *   Select "View details".
    *   Change the "App type" from "App" to "Game".
    *   Press B to go back.
3.  **(Recommended) Restart Console:** Select "Restart console" from the Dev Home main menu.

## Step 5: Launching the Game

1.  **Connect USB Drive:** Ensure your external USB drive (containing the `sab2` folder with `Settings` and `res`) is plugged into your Xbox *before* launching the game.
2.  **Launch SAB2:**
    *   After the restart, go back to Dev Home.
    *   Select "Launch Home".
    *   Navigate to "My games & apps".
    *   Find "Sonic Adventure Blast 2" (or `sab2-uwp`) under the "Games" category.
    *   Select the game and press A to launch it.
3.  **First Launch:** The game might take a few extra seconds (~5 seconds) to load the first time.

If setup was successful, Sonic Adventure Blast 2 should now launch and run! Remember this requires the USB drive with the game data to be connected whenever you play.
