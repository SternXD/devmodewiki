# GZDoom Setup and Modding on Xbox made by MewLew

This guide explains how to set up GZDoom, a source port of the Doom engine, on an Xbox Series S/X in Developer Mode, including how to install games and mods. It covers both external (USB drive) and internal (console storage) installation methods.

## External Drive Setup

This method uses a USB drive for storing game files and mods.

### 1. Prepare the External Drive

1.  **Create a GZDoom Folder:**  On your external drive (e.g., `E:\`), create a main folder for GZDoom.  You can name it `GZDoom` or something similar.

2.  **Create Subfolders:** Inside the `GZDoom` folder, create the following two subfolders:
    *   `Mods`: This folder will hold your mod files (usually `.pk3` or `.zip` files).
    *   `Games`: This folder will store your game `.wad` files (e.g., `doom.wad`, `doom2.wad`).

3.  **Copy Game Files:** Copy your game `.wad` files into the `Games` folder.  Example: `E:\GZDoom\Games\doom.wad`.

### 2. Initial GZDoom Launch and Game Selection

1.  **Install GZDoom:** Install the GZDoom application through the Xbox Dev Portal (instructions for accessing the Dev Portal are assumed to be known).
2.  **Launch GZDoom:** Launch GZDoom on your Xbox.
3. **Navigate and select your Games folder:**  You'll be prompted to select a folder.  Navigate to your external drive and select the *Games* folder you created (e.g., `E:\GZDoom\Games`).

    *   **Single Game:** If you have only one `.wad` file in the `Games` folder, GZDoom will load that game automatically.
    *   **Multiple Games:** If you have multiple `.wad` files, a basic menu will appear.
        *   Use the **B** button to scroll through the list if there are more than six games.
        *   Use the **A** button to select a game.

### 3. Modding (External Drive)

1.  **Copy Mod Files:** Copy your mod files (`.pk3` or `.zip` files) into the `Mods` folder (e.g., `E:\GZDoom\Mods`).

2. **Launch GZDoom Once:**  Follow steps 1-3 from section 2. (Initial GZDoom Launch and Game Selection) to generate an ini file, if this hasn't been done already.

3.  **Locate the INI File:** Find the `gzdoom_portable.ini` file within your `Games` folder.  Example: `E:\GZDoom\Games\gzdoom_portable.ini`.

4.  **Edit the INI File:**
    *   Open `gzdoom_portable.ini` using a text editor (like Notepad on Windows).
    *   Find the `[Global.Autoload]` section.  This section applies mods to *all* games.
    *   Add a `Path=` line for *each* mod you want to load globally, specifying the *full path* to the mod file.  Example:

    ```ini
    [Global.Autoload]
    Path=E:\GZDoom\Mods\Universal_Enhanced_AI.pk3
    ```

    *   **Game-Specific Mods:** To load mods for a *specific* game only, find the section for that game (e.g., `[doom.id.Autoload]` for the original Doom).  Add the `Path=` lines for the mods under that specific section. Example:

    ```ini
    [doom.id.Autoload]
    Path=E:\GZDoom\Mods\brutalv21.pk3
    ```

5.  **Save the INI File:**  Save the changes you made to `gzdoom_portable.ini`. Ensure it's saved back into your `Games` folder.

6.  **Launch and Play:** Launch GZDoom. Your selected mods should now be active.

## Internal Setup

This method uses the Xbox's internal storage.

### 1. Initial GZDoom Setup

1.  **Install and Launch:** Install GZDoom via the Dev Portal and launch it *once*.
2.  **Exit GZDoom:** When prompted to select a folder, press the **B** button to exit GZDoom.  This initial launch creates necessary folders.

### 2. Access the Xbox Filesystem

1.  **Open Dev Portal:** On your PC, open the Xbox Dev Portal (instructions for accessing the Dev Portal are assumed to be known).
2.  **Navigate to LocalState:** Use the Dev Portal's File Explorer to navigate to the following directory: `LocalAppData > GZDoom > LocalState`.

### 3. Copy Game Files

1.  **Copy WADs:** Copy your game `.wad` files *directly* into the `LocalState` folder (not into a subfolder).

### 4. Launch and Play (Internal)

1.  **Launch GZDoom:** Launch GZDoom on your Xbox.

    *   **Single Game:** If you have only one `.wad` file, GZDoom will load it automatically.
    *   **Multiple Games:** If multiple `.wad` files are present, a menu will appear.
        *   Use **B** to scroll (if more than six games).
        *   Use **A** to select.

### 5. Modding (Internal)

1.  **Create Mods Folder:** Inside the `LocalState` folder, create a new folder named `Mods` (if it doesn't already exist).

2.  **Copy Mod Files:** Copy your mod files (`.pk3` or `.zip`) into the `Mods` folder.

3.  **Locate the INI File:** Find the `gzdoom_portable.ini` file within the `LocalState` folder and save it to your PC.

4.  **Edit the INI File:**
    *   Open `gzdoom_portable.ini` in a text editor.
    *   Locate the `[Global.Autoload]` section.
    *   Add a `Path=` line for each mod, specifying the *relative* path from the `LocalState` folder. Example:

    ```ini
    [Global.Autoload]
    Path=Mods\Universal_Enhanced_AI.pk3
    ```

    *   **Game-Specific Mods:** For game-specific mods, add the `Path=` lines under the appropriate section (e.g., `[doom.id.Autoload]`). Example:

    ```ini
    [doom.id.Autoload]
    Path=Mods\brutalv21.pk3
    ```

5. **Save and Reupload:** Save your modified `gzdoom_portable.ini` to your PC, then using the **Dev Portal**, upload and replace the `gzdoom_portable.ini` back into the `LocalState` folder on your Xbox.

6.  **Launch and Play:** Launch GZDoom; your mods should be loaded.

## Notes and Tips

:::note
**Global vs. Specific Mods:** Mods listed under `[Global.Autoload]` will be loaded for *all* games.  To load mods only for specific games, add them under the relevant game-specific section (e.g., `[doom.doom2.Autoload]` for Doom II).
:::

:::note
**Conflicting Mods:** Avoid loading multiple mods that conflict with each other unless they are specifically designed to be compatible.
:::

:::note
**INI File Customization:**  The `.ini` file can also be used to customize various settings:
- **Graphics:** Adjust resolution, visual effects, and other graphical options.
- **Controls:**  Remap keyboard, mouse, and gamepad inputs to your preferences.
