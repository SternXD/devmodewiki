## Important Notices

:::caution
**Read the Guides:**  Before asking for help, thoroughly read the `#dev-mode-guide` channel (presumably in a Discord server) and the USB tutorial in `#app-guides` if using USB storage.  If you're still stuck, ask for help in `#support`.
:::

:::info
**Dolphin PC is Recommended:**  Think of the PC version of Dolphin as an extended settings menu for Dolphin UWP.  While not strictly *required*, Dolphin PC is extremely useful (and sometimes necessary) for many features and configurations.  This guide assumes basic familiarity with Dolphin PC. A powerful PC is *not* required for this.
:::

## Initial Setup - USB (Recommended)

This method uses a USB drive for storing games and Dolphin's user data.

### Adding Games

1.  **Open Dolphin Settings:** On your Xbox, launch Dolphin UWP.  Press the Select/View button on your controller to open the Dolphin settings menu.
2.  **Add Game Path:** Select "Add Path".
3.  **Choose Game Location:** Navigate to where your games are stored on your USB drive.  The guide suggests the following structure:
    *   `E:\Games\Nintendo - GameCube`
    *   `E:\Games\Nintendo - Wii`

### Setting the User Folder

The User Folder is where Dolphin stores important files like:

*   Texture Packs
*   Controller Configurations
*   AR/Gecko Codes (Cheats)
*   Box Art

1.  **Create Dolphin Folder:** On your USB drive, create a folder at the *root level* (e.g., `E:\`) named `Dolphin`.

2.  **Open Dolphin Settings:** Launch Dolphin UWP and press Select/View to open the settings.

3.  **Set User Folder Path:** Go to "Paths & Folders" > "Add Path" and select the `Dolphin` folder you just created.

4.  **Automatic Folder Creation:** The first time you launch a game, Dolphin will automatically create its necessary subfolders (like `Load`, `Config`, `GC`, `Wii`) inside the User Folder you specified.

## Initial Setup - Internal (Not Recommended)

:::warning
Using internal storage is *strongly discouraged* due to its limitations (30GB) and the risk of undeletable files if the app is uninstalled incorrectly (requiring a factory reset).  However, if you don't have a Windows PC to format a USB drive, this is your only option.
:::

### Adding Games

1.  **Connect via FTP:** Use Durango FTP (see `#app-guides` for instructions) to connect to your Xbox from your PC.

2.  **Create Game Folder:** Navigate to: `LocalFolder\[FULLNAME]\LocalCache`.  Replace `[FULLNAME]` with the actual full name of the Dolphin UWP application folder (see "How to find the FULLNAME of Dolphin" below).  Inside `LocalCache`, create a new folder to store your games.

3.  **Add Games:** Copy your game files into the folder you just created.

4.  **Set Game Path in Dolphin:** Launch Dolphin UWP, press Select/View, select "Add Path", and choose the folder where you placed your games.

### Setting the User Folder

1.  **Create Dolphin Folder:**  Using Durango FTP, navigate to `LocalFolder\[FULLNAME]\LocalCache`. Create a new folder named `Dolphin`.

2.  **Set User Folder Path:**  Launch Dolphin UWP, press Select/View, go to "Paths & Folders" > "Add Path", and choose the `Dolphin` folder you just created.

3.  **Automatic Folder Creation:** Dolphin will automatically create its subfolders inside this `Dolphin` folder.

## How to find the FULLNAME of Dolphin:

1.  **On Xbox:** Press the Start button on the Dolphin UWP application icon in your Xbox dashboard.
2.  **Manage Game:** Choose "Manage games and add-ons".
3.  **File Info:** Select "File Info".
4.  **Full Name:** The full name of the application folder will be displayed at the top.  Use this name when navigating via FTP or a file explorer.

## File Transfers

### Folder Info

*   `LOCALFOLDER`:  Lists all UWP application folders that allow file interaction (e.g., RetroArch, Minecraft).
*   `D:\`:
    *   **Retail Mode:**  This is your USB drive.
    *   **Dev Mode:**  This is where applications are installed (e.g., RetroArch cores).
*   `E:\`: This is your USB drive in Dev Mode.

**See the DurangoFTP Guide in `#app-guides` for detailed file transfer instructions.**

### Syncing Dolphin's User Folder on Windows

This is *highly recommended* for easier configuration.

1.  **Add Game Paths on PC:**  On your PC, add paths to your games in Dolphin PC.
2.  **Dolphin Wiki:** Right-click each game in Dolphin PC and view its page on the Dolphin Wiki for game-specific information and settings.
3.  **Properties (PC):** Right-click a game and click "Properties" to apply changes like Gecko/AR codes.
4.  **Open User Folder (PC):** Go to File > Open User Folder in Dolphin PC.
5.  **Copy Files:** Copy any files or folders you want (e.g., `Config`, `GameSettings`, `GC`, `Wii`) from the Dolphin PC User Folder to the Dolphin UWP User Folder on your Xbox (either on your USB drive or via FTP to the internal storage).

### Syncing Dolphin's User Folder on Mobile

Android and iOS don't natively support writing to NTFS-formatted drives (required for Xbox USB emulation).

1.  **Use FTP:**  Use Durango FTP on your Xbox and an FTP client app on your mobile device.
2.  **MiXplorer (Recommended):**  The guide recommends MiXplorer for Android (free, supports FTP).

## Netplay Guide

Netplay allows online multiplayer for GameCube and Wii games with local multiplayer modes.

*   **GameCube Netplay:** Generally stable.
*   **Wii Netplay:**  More experimental and temperamental.

### Requirements

*   **Same Game:** All players must have the *same game* on their game list.
*   **Low Bandwidth:** Bandwidth requirements are low, but latency (ping) is crucial.  Ethernet is recommended over Wi-Fi.
*   **Identical Game Copies:** Each player needs their own copy of the game, with matching region and revision.  Identical dumps are *strongly recommended*. Most compressed formats work with standard ISOs (except NKit).
*   **Same Dolphin Version:** All players *must* use the same Dolphin version. Newer versions are better.

### Starting a Netplay Session

1.  **Open Netplay Menu:** In Dolphin UWP on your Xbox, go to the "Net-play" menu.
2.  **Host or Join:** Choose "Host" or "Join".

### Hosting a Netplay Session

1.  **Host Options:**
    *   **Direct Connection:** Requires port forwarding on your router.
    *   **Traversal Server (Recommended):**  Avoids port forwarding and uses a code for joining.
    *   **Port:**  Select a specific port (if using Direct Connection).
    *   **Name:** Set a name to identify yourself.

2.  **Best Host:** The player with the best internet connection and (for 3+ players) the most central geographic location makes the best host.

3.  **NAT:** Players with strict NAT may need to manually port forward, even when joining.

4.  **Port Forwarding:**  Instructions vary by router.  You'll need admin access to your router.

5.  **Host Menu:** After selecting a game and hosting method, you'll enter the host Netplay menu.
    *   **Traversal Code:** If using the Traversal Server, you'll get a code to share with other players.
    *   **IP and Port:** If using Direct Connection, you'll need to share your public IP address and port.

:::note
**Multiple Routers:**  Can cause complications.  You might need to manually find your public IP.
:::

:::note
**Mixed Connection Types:** You can host on the Traversal Server but allow trusted users (e.g., on your LAN) to connect directly using your IP and port.
:::

:::note
**Traversal Server Latency:**  The Traversal Server *does not* add latency; it's only for connecting.
:::

:::note
**Host Responsibilities:** The host configures the input buffer, enables/disables features, and assigns controllers.
:::

### Joining a Netplay Session

1.  **Set Name:**  Enter the name you want to use.
2.  **Enter Code or IP:**
    *   **Traversal Code:** Enter the code provided by the host.
    *   **IP Address and Port:** Enter the host's IP address and port (for Direct Connection).
3.  **Wait:** Wait for the host to start the game.

### Unable to Join a Netplay Session

*   **Strict NAT:**  The Traversal Server may not work.  The host must port forward, and clients must use Direct Connection.
*   **Version Incompatibilities:** Older Dolphin builds might not warn about incompatible versions. Newer builds have an error message.

**Port Forwarding:** Consult a guide specific to your router model.

### Configuring a Netplay Session

The host can adjust these settings before starting the game:

*   **Buffer:** The amount of latency added to inputs.  Increase if you experience slowdown or stuttering, even in low-impact scenes.  A general formula: 1 pad buffer per 15ms of latency per client.
*   **Strict Settings Sync:**  More aggressively synchronizes settings (e.g., Internal Resolution).  Use if you have a desync with an unknown cause.
*   **Saves on Netplay:** GameCube and Wii saves now work on Netplay, the host's local saves will be used.

### Desync Troubleshooting

*   **Mismatched ISOs:**  The most common cause.  Ensure all players have identical game dumps.
*   **Slow Internet:**  Low bandwidth or high latency can cause desyncs.
*   **Mismatched SD Card:**  If a game requires an SD card, *all players must have identical SD card files*.

## Netplay with PC

*   **Version Check:** To see the Dolphin UWP version compared to the PC version, check the settings tab in Dolphin UWP or the GitHub releases page.

## Resources (Optional)

### Where to Find Resources

*   **Xbox Emulation Hub Discord:** The best place for pre-configured resources is the `#resources` channel in the Xbox Emulation Hub Discord server.
*   **Dolphin Wiki:** For games without listed resources, check the game's page on the Dolphin Wiki.

### Importing Wii and GameCube Saves

7.  **Enable Cheats:**  Ensure cheats are enabled in Dolphin UWP's settings before starting the game.

### Control Mapping

Configuring controls directly on Xbox is currently limited to premade configurations.  For custom controls, use Dolphin PC:

1.  **Connect Controller (PC):** Connect your Xbox controller via USB or Bluetooth.
2.  **Select Controller (PC):**  In Dolphin PC, select "WGInput/0/Xbox One Game Controller" as your input device.
3.  **Configure Controls (PC):**  Set up your controls.
4.  **Save Profile (PC):**  Save your controller profile.
5.  **Locate Profile (PC):**  Find your saved profile in the Dolphin PC User Folder:
    *   Wiimote: `Config/Profiles/Wiimote`
    *   GameCube: `Config/Profiles/GCPad`
6.  **Copy Profile (Xbox):** Copy the profile file to the *same location* within the Dolphin UWP User Folder on your Xbox.

**Simplified Steps:**

1.  Create/download a profile in Dolphin PC using your Xbox controller.
2.  Transfer the profile to `Config/Profiles/Wiimote` or `Config/Profiles/GCPad` in the Dolphin UWP User Folder.
3.  In Dolphin UWP, select the profile for the desired controller port and choose the correct device.

### Texture Packs

1.  **Download:** Download a texture pack.
2.  **Place in Folder:**  Place the texture pack folder in `Dolphin/Load/Textures`.
3.  **Enable:**
    *   **Global:** Go to Main Menu > Advanced and enable:
        *   Load Custom Textures
        *   Prefetch Custom Textures (disable if you have issues)
    *   **Per-Game:** Create a `GameID.ini` file in your `GameSettings` folder (replace `GameID` with the actual Game ID).  Add these lines to the INI:

    ```plaintext
    [Video_Settings]
    HiresTextures = True
    CacheHiresTextures = True
    ```

4.  **Verify Game ID:** Make sure the main texture pack folder name matches the Game ID (or the first 3 characters of the ID).

## Themes

*Written by Fffathur*

*   **Change Theme:** Go to Settings > Interface > Themes and select a theme.
*   **Create Theme:** Create a new folder in `/Themes/` (within your User Folder) and include these *required* files:
    *   `carousel_background_all.png` (Default carousel view)
    *   `menu_background.png` (Settings background)
    *   `list_ui.png` (UI overlay for list view)
    *   `carousel_ui.png` (UI overlay for carousel view)
*   **Optional Files:**
    *   `carousel_background_wii.png` (Wii tab)
    *   `carousel_background_gamecube.png` (GameCube tab)
    *   `carousel_background_other.png` (Other tab)
    *   `carousel_background_list.png` (List screen)

*Written by jpolo1224. Redone by Jeen*

**Prerequisites:**

1.  Brawl ISO (or WBFS).
2.  Dolphin 1.16 installed.

**Setting Up Default ISO:**

1.  **Locate dolphin.ini:** Navigate to your Xbox Dolphin User Folder > `config` > `dolphin.ini`.
2.  **Add DefaultISO:** Under `[Core]`, add this line: `DefaultISO=` followed by the *full path* to your Brawl ISO on your Xbox.
    *   **Simplified Method:**
        1.  Add your game path on PC Dolphin.
        2.  Set Brawl as the default ISO on PC Dolphin.
        3.  Boot the game on PC Dolphin.
        4.  Close the game.
        5.  Go to `config`, `paths` in the PC Dolphin User Folder, and copy the `DefaultISO` path.
        6.  Paste this path into your Xbox `dolphin.ini` file.
        7. Or find it in your PC dolphin.ini.

**Downloading PMEX Remix:**

1.  **Visit Website:** Visit the PMEX Remix website: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u6aENdnSyDio-CmpNRLg8NXxc8xoYfQh](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u6aENdnSyDio-CmpNRLg8NXxc8xoYfQh) to download the necessary files.

2.  **Download Launchers:** Download the *offline* and *netplay* launchers (.elf files). These are for solo/local play and online multiplayer, respectively. You'll find these in separate folders within the Google Drive.

3.  **Place Launchers:** Place the downloaded .elf files into your *games folder* on your Xbox (the same folder where you have your Brawl ISO/WBFS). This could be on your USB drive (recommended) or internal storage (not recommended).

4.  **Obtain SD Card:** From the PMEX Remix Dolphin download (likely a .zip or .7z file), find the `Wii` folder. Inside, there should be a folder named `sd`. Rename this folder to `WiiSD`.

5.  **Replace WiiSD.raw:** Replace the existing `WiiSD.raw` file in your Dolphin UWP *Load* folder (on your Xbox) with the renamed `WiiSD` folder you just prepared. This contains the mod's data.

**Launching PMEX Remix:**

1.  **Launch Launcher:** In Dolphin UWP on your Xbox, launch the .elf file corresponding to the mode you want:
    *   **PMEX Offline Launcher:** For full game access from the title screen (single-player, local multiplayer).
    *   **NETPLAY Launcher:** For online multiplayer.

2.  **Enjoy:** The modded Super Smash Bros. Brawl should now load.
