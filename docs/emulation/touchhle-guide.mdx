# TouchHLE UWP Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up TouchHLE, an emulator for early iOS applications (iOS 3 and under), on an Xbox Series S/X console running in Developer Mode.

**Important:**
*   This is a work-in-progress emulator. Compatibility is limited, and many games may not work correctly or at all.
*   **An External USB Drive is REQUIRED** for this emulator. It is used to store necessary system files and the game itself.
*   This guide is based on the setup process demonstrated in the referenced video.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following conditions are met:

1.  **Xbox Developer Mode Activated:** Your Xbox Series S/X must be successfully set up and running in Developer Mode.
2.  **Remote Access Enabled:** Remote Access must be enabled and configured within the Xbox Dev Home application.
3.  **External USB Drive:** A USB drive formatted as NTFS with full read/write permissions set for UWP applications.
4.  **PC:** A Windows PC for downloading files and accessing the Xbox Device Portal.
5.  **iOS Game Files:** Your own legally dumped and **decrypted** iOS game files (`.ipa` format) compatible with iOS 3 or under.

> **Need help with prerequisites?** See the [_Xbox Developer Mode Setup_](/docs/xbox-setup/xbox-developer-mode-setup) guide for detailed instructions on activating Dev Mode, setting up Remote Access, and preparing a USB drive.

## Step 1: Downloading Files

You will need to download two separate packages: the UWP application for the Xbox and the standard PC version to extract necessary files.

### 1.1. Download the TouchHLE UWP App

1.  **Download TouchHLE for Xbox:** See the [Installation](#installation) section below for download instructions.
2.  **Find TouchHLE:** Navigate to the **"Emulators"** tab and find **"TouchHLE (ALPHA)"**.
3.  **Download:** Click the **"Download"** button. This downloads a `.zip` file containing the UWP app and dependencies.
4.  **Extract Files:** On your PC, extract the downloaded `.zip` file. Inside, you should find the main `.msixbundle` or `.appx` file and several dependency `.appx` files.

### 1.2. Download the TouchHLE PC Version (for required assets)

1.  **Download PC Version for Required Files:** Go to the official TouchHLE GitHub releases page: [**https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/releases**](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/releases).
2.  **Download the Windows `.zip` file** from the latest stable release (e.g., `touchHLE-vX.X.X-windows_x86_64.zip`).
3.  **Extract PC Files:** Extract this second `.zip` file to a separate, known location on your PC. We will need files from this folder later.

## Step 2: Install via Device Portal

1.  **Access Dev Portal:** On your PC, open a web browser and connect to your Xbox Device Portal.
2.  **Bypass Security Warning:** If necessary, bypass the browser's security warning.
3.  **Navigate to "Add":** Under "My games & apps", click "Add".
4.  **Upload Main Package:** Click "Choose File" (or drag and drop) and select the TouchHLE `.msixbundle` or `.appx` file from the **UWP download** (Step 1.1).
5.  **Upload Dependencies:** Click "Next". Add **all** the dependency files from the UWP download one by one.
6.  **Start Installation:** Click "Start" and wait for completion ("Package successfully registered"). Click "Done".

## Step 3: Configure on Xbox

1.  **Locate TouchHLE in Dev Home:** On your Xbox, go to Dev Home. Find `TouchHLE`.
2.  **Change Type to "Game":** Highlight the app > Press "View" button > "View details" > Change "App type" to "Game" > Press B.
3.  **(Recommended) Restart Console:** Select "Restart console" from the Dev Home main menu.

## Step 4: Prepare External USB Drive (CRITICAL)

This step requires placing specific folders and files from the **PC version of TouchHLE** onto your USB drive.

1.  **Connect USB Drive:** Plug your prepared external USB drive into your PC.
2.  **Create `iOS` Folder:** At the *root* of your USB drive (e.g., `E:\`), create a new folder named exactly `iOS`.
3.  **Copy Folders to Root:**
    *   Navigate to the folder where you extracted the **PC version** of TouchHLE (from Step 1.2).
    *   Find the `touchHLE_dylibs` and `touchHLE_fonts` folders.
    *   Copy *both* of these folders to the **root** of your USB drive (e.g., to `E:\`).
4.  **Copy Config Files:**
    *   Still in the PC version folder, find the `touchHLE_default_options.txt` file.
    *   Copy this file to the **root** of your USB drive (e.g., to `E:\`).
    *   Now, find the `touchHLE_options.txt` file.
    *   Copy this file *into* the `iOS` folder you created on your USB drive (e.g., to `E:\iOS`).

Your USB drive should now have this structure at its root:
*   `E:\touchHLE_dylibs` (folder)
*   `E:\touchHLE_fonts` (folder)
*   `E:\iOS` (folder, containing `touchHLE_options.txt`)
*   `E:\touchHLE_default_options.txt` (file)

## Step 5: Adding and Launching a Game

The UWP port currently loads games in a specific way.

1.  **Obtain Game:** Get your decrypted iOS game file (`.ipa`). For testing, you can legally download compatible freeware games like "Touch & Go" directly from the **iOS App Archive**: [**https://touchhle.org/app-archive/**](https://touchhle.org/app-archive/).
2.  **Rename Game File:** You **must** rename your game file to exactly `app.ipa`.
3.  **Place Game on USB:** Copy the renamed `app.ipa` file to the **root** of your USB drive (e.g., `E:\app.ipa`).
4.  **Connect and Launch:**
    *   Safely eject the USB drive from your PC and connect it to your Xbox.
    *   Launch TouchHLE from the Xbox dashboard.
5.  **Update Prompt:**
    *   You may see a "TouchHLE Update Available" prompt. **It is highly recommended to select "NO" for now.**
6.  **Play:** The game should now launch.

## Step 6: Controls

The controller emulates touch input:

*   **Right Stick:** Moves the touch cursor.
*   **Right Stick Click (R3) or Right Bumper (RB):** Simulates a screen tap.
*   **Left Stick:** Simulates device tilt/gyro controls.

## Step 7: Advanced Configuration (e.g., Fullscreen)

You can set per-game options, like forcing fullscreen, by editing `touchHLE_options.txt`.

1.  **Launch Game Once:** Launch the game you want to configure at least once. This generates a log file.
2.  **Find Game Identifier:**
    *   Connect the USB drive back to your PC.
    *   Navigate into the `E:\iOS` folder.
    *   Open the newly created `touchHLE_log.txt` file.
    *   Look for a line that starts with `Identifier:`. Copy the full identifier string (e.g., `com.thegamecreators.TouchAndGo`).
3.  **Edit Options File:**
    *   Open the `touchHLE_options.txt` file located in `E:\iOS`.
    *   On a new line, paste the identifier you copied.
    *   Immediately after the identifier, add a colon (`:`).
    *   After the colon, add the command-line option you want to use. For fullscreen, use `--fullscreen`.
    *   The final line should look like this: `com.thegamecreators.TouchAndGo:--fullscreen`
4.  **Save and Relaunch:** Save the `touchHLE_options.txt` file, connect the USB back to your Xbox, and launch the game. It should now run with the specified options.

> **Tip:** You can find a list of all available options (like `--scale-hack`, controller button mapping, etc.) by looking inside the `OPTIONS_HELP.txt` file included with the **PC version** of TouchHLE.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Game is a tiny window:** The game is not running in fullscreen. Follow **Step 7** to add the `--fullscreen` option for your game's identifier in `touchHLE_options.txt`.
*   **Game won't launch:**
    *   Ensure your `.ipa` file is renamed to exactly `app.ipa` and is located at the **root** of your USB drive.
    *   Verify the game is decrypted and compatible with iOS 3 or under.
    *   Check that the `touchHLE_dylibs`, `touchHLE_fonts`, and other required files are correctly placed on the USB drive as described in **Step 4**.
*   **Game layout is broken (e.g., horizontal instead of vertical):** This may happen if you accept the in-app update. For now, it is best to **decline the update** when prompted. If you've already updated, you may need to reinstall the original version from the Dev Store.
