# Xbox Developer Mode Setup Guide

This comprehensive guide will walk you through setting up Xbox Developer Mode on your Xbox console for emulation and homebrew development.

## Preliminary Steps

### Important Notes

:::caution
If you are in the Xbox Update Preview program, ensure that you exit it before switching on Dev Mode. This step helps in preventing the E208 error.

Here's how to exit:

1. Open the Xbox Insider App
2. Navigate to **Xbox Update Preview > Manage > Leave Preview**
3. Update your console through settings
:::

:::warning
⚠️ Switching between Dev and Retail Modes deletes your Quick Resume states and any local captures. To save captures, use an external USB drive.

## Registering for a Developer Account

Microsoft now uses an onboarding flow for developer accounts individual developer accounts are free, while company accounts require a one-time fee. You still need a Microsoft account (an ordinary account at https://account.microsoft.com/) to sign in to the onboarding flow.

### Quick Overview

- **Sign in**: Go to the onboarding page and sign in with your Microsoft account.
- **Choose account type**: Select **Individual developer** (Free) or **Company** (paid).
- **Identity verification**: Complete the verification steps (photo ID, phone verification, etc.).
- **Profile details**: Fill in contact and profile information.
- **Account setup**: Complete any required payments for company accounts and finalize your developer profile.

### Steps

1. Open the onboarding page in your browser: https://storedeveloper.microsoft.com/onboarding

2. Sign in with the Microsoft account you want tied to developer tools (if you don't have one, create it at https://account.microsoft.com/ first).

3. Choose the account type. For most hobbyists and homebrew developers, select **Individual developer** (it is marked "Free"). If you're registering as a company or publishing under an organization name, select **Company** this requires a one-time registration fee ($99 USD).

4. Complete identity verification (have your ID and phone ready):

   - Take a live photo of your government-issued photo ID and a selfie. Use the original physical document (do not upload a scanned or photocopied image).
   - Ensure the ID is not expired and that all text, numbers and the photo are clearly legible.
   - Complete phone verification via SMS if prompted.

   Tip: The verification step **will** block further progress until completed. Completing the ID photo and phone verification in one session speeds up the process.

5. Fill in your profile details (display name, contact email, country/region). For company accounts you'll also provide company details and pay the one-time registration fee when prompted.

6. Review and submit. After verification and any required payment, your developer account will be created. You should receive confirmation emails and be able to access the Store dashboard.

### Notes and troubleshooting

- **Individual accounts are free**: If you picked the Individual option you will not be charged, but you still **must** complete identity verification.
- **Company accounts require payment**: If you pick Company, be ready with a payment method for the one-time fee verification may take longer for organizations.
- **If verification fails**: Retry with a different ID or contact Microsoft support from the onboarding page.
- **Processing time**: Account approval may take from a few minutes to several hours depending on verification.
